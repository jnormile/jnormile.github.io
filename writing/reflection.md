# CMPSC 480: Portfolio project reflection

This assignment had a number of technical challenges, but most of these
involved coming to grips with `njk`--the language used by the template
I opted into. Though *very* similar to CSS, the handful of differences that
existed threw me for a loop in unexpected ways early on, building a sort of
trepidation to tinker with the theme too much. Ultimately I reminded myself
of the projects that I've already encountered in my fledgling programming
career, and decided it was a *little* silly to be so intimidated by something
that was already so similar to what I had previously worked with.

It also gave me pause to think about how I want myself to be perceived by
professional communities. What kind of *vibe* do I want to give off to
prospective employers? What's my *brand* look and feel like? In the end I
opted for a look that I can only describe as "clean"--splashes of color
from a limited pallete, a consistent feel across iconography and imagery
employed, etc. It's certainly not as adventurous as other professional
sites that I've examined in preparation for the project, but I also don't
feel that my work has *earned* that level of freely eschewing the rules
in terms of professionalism.

All in all I have a product that I'm happy with--*for now*. I certainly aim
to continue to build and improve on what I have, but it's a foundation that
I can live with and feel confident showcasing at my current stage in my
journey as a programmer.
