After spending about a decade in retail leadership, I decided to make the trek back to school to pick up some new skills in the realm of software development. Combining my professional experience leading teams dedicated to customer service and operational efficiency with this newly acquired technical expertise, I know I’m uniquely positioned to offer insights on software projects that can’t be replicated by other junior-level developers.
